# Reddit Clone App on Kubernetes with Ingress

Designed and implemented a robust continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipeline for a Reddit clone application. The pipeline incorporated Docker, Docker Hub, and Kubernetes Minikube technologies to achieve a seamless, automated flow from code changes to deployment.

Set up an automated pipeline that integrated code changes from the development team and tested them before pushing the updated container images to Docker Hub. This ensured that any changes made were thoroughly tested before deployment, thus improving the overall quality of the application.

Used Kubernetes Minikube to deploy the container images to the appropriate environment based on the results of the tests. The application was designed to be highly available and scalable, leveraging Kubernetes features such as services and ingress.

 Technologies used: Docker, Docker Hub, Kubernetes, Minikube, CI/CD, Containerization, Automation, Monitoring, Logging, Reddit Clone Application.
